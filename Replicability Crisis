Power posing: theoretically effects how powerful one feels and can change hormonal levels 

Reproduce Analysis: To make sure the results are accurate. 

Example: replicating cancer studies, rerunning psychology studies & published results. False findings are the predominant published results in market. 

Replicability crisis: Used to undermine science. 

Unscrupulous research: p-hacking, linear models, Bassein models, p-values.

Overestimating effect: occurrence due to skewed p-value analysis, skewed sample sizes, DFTBAQ. 

Replication: more funding needed 

Null Result: re-analyze to understand statistical significance much more precisely. True/false positive. True/false negatives. 

Statical power: the ability to detect real effect. Use “false discovery rate” formula. 

Publish data publicly to reduce errors. 

Science is a push and pull of idea. They refine ideas and build upon previous research. This is why replication is important.
